####Automatically restart server when files change
By default, node will not monitor for file changes after your server has been started. This means youâ€™d have to shut down and start the server every time you made a file change. This can be fixed with **nodemon**. To use: install nodemon globally **npm install -g nodemon**. Start your server with **nodemon server.js** now. Smooth sailing from there.
